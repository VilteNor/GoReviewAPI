## Project Overview 
________________________

This collaborative project was completed as part of the Bright Network Technology Academy programme. This project aimed to build a back end for a restaurant review website, it consisted of a User who would log on to the website, and then place a review on one of their most recently visited restaurants. 

In the review the user can create a new restaurant if the restaurant is not already in the database, other functionality included in the review section are:
- the user can also give a rating out of 5
- give a rating of the price of the restaurant 
- an optional message 
- can attach lables to the review including, different types of accesible features and  diet 

The API was created using Java, and Spring boot, as well as, using Postman for testing.

## Step-By-Step Instructions for Initial Setup 
_______________________________

1. Make sure that you have installed Java.
2. Clone this repository : git clone git@github.com:VilteNor/GoReviewAPI.git and open in you Java IDE
3. If you don't already have it, download Postman so that you can interact with the API, the HTTP quereis you will make will be on : localhost:8081/(command inserted here)

## UML and ERD Diagrams:

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP): 
_______________________________

For our MVP we wanted to create an app with CRUD funtionality with 3x classes:
- Users
- Restaurants 
- Reviews

## Extensions: 
_______________________________

for our extentions we wanted to add the following functionality 

- get the average rating for each restaurant 
- create a moderator class, where when the user does complete a review it will enter the pending section, and be reviewed by the moderator 
- dont let a user write a review to the same restaurant for atleast 7 days
- retrieve a list of restaurants by using an inputted enum. 
- retrieve a list of reviews by using an inputted enum.

## Testing: 
_______________________________

The project was tested through postman. The application created is the HTTP client and many http requests were wriiten as a way to test if the expected reponces were recieved,
preventing bugs and improving performance.


Here is an example of an example test:

## Final Comments: 
_______________________________

If we were to add further implementations to the project, we would add:
-  more of our extentions, but were not able to due to time constraints
- authentication and security features to our website through spring security
- some J-unit tests, or have worked in TDD style manner.


We would also like to acknoledge the BNTA team, and all the trainers for there amazing support during the program!
